# cbox_finder

Lafayette I survey cards have an area on their right side where there
are some 'checkboxes'; these were filled with "XX" or similar to check
them off when the survey cards were typed up.

This tool loads a template checkbox image, then enumerates Lafayette I
survey cards, searching for and marking where the template was found.

## Todo

* Cut out and average the checkbox images, to make a better template
* Experiment with different templates (changing size, etc.) to see if
  it can be made more robust
